Would recommend:
* Language in Thought and Action by S. I. Hayakawa (A fun read about semantics. Recommended to a friend as a "practical linguistic book", she was astonished: "How can linguistics be practical?" lol)
* Analysing Sentences : An Introduction to English Syntax

Not a fan of:
* Linguistics: a Very Short Introduction by P.H. Matthews

In progress:
* Linguistics, an Introduction to Language and Communication by Adrian Akmajian, Ann K. Farmer, Lee Bickmore, Richard A. Demers, Robert M. Harnish
* An Intoduction to Language by Nina Hyams, Victoria Fromkin, Robert Rodman
* The Infinite Gift: How Children Learn and Unlearn the Languages of the World by Charles Yang

To read:
* Language Instinct by Steven Pinker
* Explain Me This by Adele Goldberg

Any recommendations welcomed! <dyliu567@gmail.com>
