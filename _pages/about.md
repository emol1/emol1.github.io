Hi there! I am Oli, an [MPhil](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/acs) student studying computer science at the University of Cambridge. I recently graduated from the Cambridge [Engineering Department](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) where I specialised in information engineering but also learnt a *lot* (more than I had expected) about electrical ([a radio that I designed](https://olidyliu.github.io/files/IEP.pdf)), structural([a cantilever that I designed and built from metal sheets](https://olidyliu.github.io/files/structural_design.pdf)), material, and mechanical engineering. During the second half of my undergraduate, I focused on signal processing, information theory and probabilistic inference. My final year project was on diarisation, which is the task of [partitioning an input audio stream into homogenous segments according to speaker identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_diarisation). To put it more simply, while speech recognition gives us "what was said", diarisation answers "who said which part".<br/>
Although an engineer by training, I am deeply interested in languages. What particularly intigue me are computational models of language acquisiton in humans, as well as the inherent stuctures and constraints needed to enable computers to learn and use languages beyond exploiting statistical regularities. As one of the many people who use second languages with much higher frequency and intensity than our mother tongues, my everyday life is ridden with occurences that constantly reinforce me curiosity and motivation to learn about second language acquisition. I also have a growing interest in syntax and parsing (thanks to [this amazing module](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2021/L95/) that I'm taking!). After spending some time drawing syntax trees myself, I realize that the more I learn about language, the harder I find it to understand and explain human's natural mastery of language. <br/>
Besides languages and maths, music is my favorite (hence the description in the side bar). I started teaching myself guitar three years  ago and am now trying to pick up keyboard at the same time. [Singing to my guitar](https://youtu.be/XQkgYolF2hU) (at the middle of the night in particular) kept me sane when I was working on my final year thesis while anxiously waiting for masters' application decisions during lockdown. Running and reading (and [reading about running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running)) also helped!
