Hi there! I am Oli, an [MPhil](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/acs) student studying computer science at the University of Cambridge. An information engineer by training, I am deeply fascinated by computational linguistics & cognitive science as well as the more applied field of natural language processing. Topics that particularly interest me include (but are not limited to):
* Computational modeling for language acquisition 
* Lexical semantics in distributed representations
* Bayesian methods for NLP

I am also trying my best (to take time from my intense masters' courses) to learn about formal semantics and the philosophy of language. Any beginner-level materials suitable for people coming from a technical background would be much appreciated!<br>
Apart from maths and linguistics, music is my absolute favorite. Singing to my guitar (at the middle of the night in particular) kept me sane when I was working on my final year thesis while anxiously waiting for masters' application decisions during lockdown, being one of the only two people left in the entire house. Running and reading and [reading about running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running) also helped!
