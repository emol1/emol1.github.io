Hi there! I am Oli, an [MPhil](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/acs) student studying computer science at the University of Cambridge. I recently graduated [engineering department](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) where I specialised in information engineering but also learnt a *lot* (more than I ever thought I would) about electrical ([a radio that I designed](https://olidyliu.github.io/files/IEP.pdf)), structural([a cantilever that I designed and built from metal sheets](https://olidyliu.github.io/files/structural_design.pdf)), material, and mechanical engineering. During the second half of my undergraduate, I focused on signal processing, information theory and probabilistic inference. My final year project was on diarisation, which is the task of "partitioning an input audio stream into homogenous segments according to speaker identity". To put it more simply, while speech recognition gives us "what was said", diarisation answers "who said which part".<br/>
Although an engineer by training, I aspire to become a computational linguist. To smooth out my switch, I converted to computer science as a first step, focusing on natural language processing. I am particularly intrigued by cognitive modeling for language acquisition using generative models. I also have a growing interest in syntax and parsing (thanks to [this amazing module](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2021/L95/) that I'm taking!).<br/>
Besides languages and maths, music is my favorite (hence the description in the side bar). I started teaching myself guitar three years  ago and am now trying to pick up keyboard at the same time. [Singing to my guitar](https://youtu.be/XQkgYolF2hU) (at the middle of the night in particular) kept me sane when I was working on my final year thesis while anxiously waiting for masters' application decisions during lockdown. Running and reading (and [reading about running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running)) also helped!
