Hi there! I am Oli, an [MPhil](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/acs) student studying computer science at the University of Cambridge. I did my undergraduate at the [engineering department](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) where I specialised in information engineering but also learnt a *lot* (more than I ever thought I would) about [electrical](https://olidyliu.github.io/files/IEP.pdf), [structural](https://olidyliu.github.io/files/structural_design.pdf), material and mechanical engineering. During the second half of my undergraduate, I focused on signal processing, information theory and probabilistic inference. My final year project was on diarisation, which is the task of "partitioning an input audio stream into homogenous segments according to speaker identity". To put it more simply, while speech recognition answers the question "what was said", diarisation answers "who said which part".\n
Although an engineer by training, I aspire to become a computational linguist. To smooth out my switch, I converted to computer science as a first step, pursuing a master focusing on natural language processing also at Cambridge. I am interested in cognitive modeling for language acquisition using Bayesian methods with a growing interest in syntax and parsing (thanks to [this amazing module](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2021/L95/) that I'm taking!).
