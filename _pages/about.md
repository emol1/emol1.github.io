Hi there! I am Oli, an [MPhil](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/acs) student studying computer science at the University of Cambridge. I recently graduated from the [Cambridge University Engineering Department](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) where I specialised in information engineering but also learnt a *lot* (more than I had expected) about electrical ([a radio that I designed](https://olidyliu.github.io/files/IEP.pdf)), structural([a cantilever that I designed and built from metal sheets](https://olidyliu.github.io/files/structural_design.pdf)), material, and mechanical engineering. During the second half of my undergraduate, I focused on signal processing, information theory and probabilistic inference. My final year project was on diarisation, which is the task of [partitioning an input audio stream into homogenous segments according to speaker identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_diarisation). To put it more simply, while speech recognition gives us "what was said", diarisation answers "who said which part".<br/>
Although an engineer by training, I am deeply interested in languages. What particularly intrigue me are computational models of language processing in humans, as well as the inherent stuctures and constraints needed to enable computers to learn and use languages beyond exploiting statistical regularities. As one of the many people who use our second languages with much higher frequency and intensity than speaking our mother tongues, my everyday life is ridden with occurences that trigger my curiosity and strengthen my motivation to learn about second language acquisition. I also have a growing interest in syntax and parsing (thanks to [this amazing module](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2021/L95/) that I'm taking!). After spending some time [drawing syntax trees](https://olidyliu.github.io/files/L95_dl567_Exercise3.pdf) *(disclaimer: this file in no way reflects my average effort in latex formatting)* and [enumerating grammatical relations](https://olidyliu.github.io/files/L95_dl567_Exercise4.pdf) (using [the scheme of the RASP parser](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-662.pdf)), I realize that the more I learn about language, the more complex I find the task of understanding and explaining human's natural mastery of language, and all the more excited I get to confront this challenge. <br/>
Besides languages and maths, music is my favorite (hence the description in the side bar). I started teaching myself guitar three years  ago and am now trying to pick up keyboard at the same time. [Singing to my guitar](https://youtu.be/XQkgYolF2hU) (at the middle of the night in particular) kept me sane when I was working on my final year thesis while anxiously waiting for masters' application decisions during lockdown, being one of the only two people left in the entire house. Running and reading (and [reading about running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running)) also helped! <br/>
おはよう！こんにちは！こんばんは！私の名前はオリです。ケンブリジ大学でにコンピュータサイエンスを専攻しています。言語学と数学にとても興味があります。JPOPが大好きです！RADWIMPS最高！<br/>
你好呀，我是刘丹仪，一名剑桥大学计算机系的研究生。我喜欢语言，数学和计算机科学。也很喜欢音乐。听歌听得很杂，最喜欢的类型是摇滚，但因为琴技和乐理太差，大多数时间都在唱无脑情歌。看过太多莫名其妙的喜剧和南方公园以至于笑点变得很奇怪。<br/>
