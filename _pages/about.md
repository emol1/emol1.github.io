Hi there! I am Oli, an [MPhil](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/acs) student studying computer science at the University of Cambridge. An information engineer by training, I am deeply fascinated by computational linguistics & cognitive science as well as the more applied field of natural language processing. Topics that particularly interest me include:
* Computational modeling for language acquisition 
* Lexical semantics in distributed representations
* Bayesian methods for NLP

I am also trying (to take time from my intense masters' courses) to learn and think about formal semantics, philosophy of language, as well as the formalist vs. functionalist debate. Any recommendations of interesting readings or beginner-level materials would be much appreciated!<br>
Apart from computer science and linguistics, music takes up most of my time. Singing to my guitar (at the middle of the night in particular) kept me sane when I was working on my final year thesis while anxiously waiting for masters' application decisions during lockdown, being one of the only two people left in the entire house. Running and reading and [reading about running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running) also helped!
