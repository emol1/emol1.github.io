Hi there! I am Oli, an [MPhil](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/acs) student studying computer science at the University of Cambridge. I did my undergraduate at the [engineering department](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) where I specialised in information engineering but also learnt a *lot* about mechanical, [electrical](https://olidyliu.github.io/files/IEP.pdf), material and [structural](https://olidyliu.github.io/files/structural_design.pdf) engineering.
